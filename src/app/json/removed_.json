    "description": "<p><strong>Zipcar</strong> is a car­sharing company that provides automobile reservations to its members, billable by the hour or day. ‘Zipsters’ pay a monthly or annual membership fee in addition to car reservations charges. As of June 2015, the company had more than 900,000 members and offers nearly 10,000 vehicles throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Austria and Turkey, making Zipcar one of the world's leading car rental networks. Members can reserve Zipcars with Zipcar's mobile app, online or by phone at any time, immediately or up to a year in advance. Zipsters have automated access to Zipcars using an access card which works with the car's technology to unlock the door, where the keys are already located inside. Zipcar also offers an iPhone or Android application that allows members to honk the horn to locate a Zipcar and unlock the doors. Zipcar charges a one-time application fee, an annual fee, and a reservation charge. Fuel, parking, insurance, and maintenance are included in the price.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Are you ready for Bubble Soccer?</strong>This new popular sport is very similar to classic soccer. The rules hardly differ from the ones of soccer, the gameplay however, may surprise you! In Bubble Soccer, the objective is still to score as many goals as possible, except that the players from each team compete in a large transparent inflatable bubble (which protects them from head to knees). The feet are then free to defy opponents and grab the ball. The bubbles will make you experience a game out of the ordinary and a totally delusional experience!</p><p>Laughter and fun are guaranteed! Bubble Ball Soccer is a sport for everyone and it requires no special skills other than a desire to have a good time so come on out to Carnaval del Sol on July 9 and 10 for a <strong>rolling good time!</strong></p>",
